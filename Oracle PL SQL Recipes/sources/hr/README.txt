The scripts contained in this directory have been modified so that they can be loaded into any schema.  These scripts do not create the HR schema, but rather, they create and populate the current schema with the HR objects.

Installation
------------

To install the constructs for working with the examples in this book, run the hr_main.sql script within the schema of your choice.
